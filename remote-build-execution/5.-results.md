    *System 2 Specifications (fastfetch output): Intel Core i5-6500T CPU, 8GB RAM, 48GB ZRAM, BTRFS filesystem.*

*   **Build Time (R8, D8, CXX, JAVAC remote build and caching):** > 5 hours
*   **Build Time (Everything cached):** ~ 4 hours 8 minutes

### Analyzing Build Results

After the build completes, you can examine `out/soong/rbe_metrics.txt` to get detailed information about RBE usage. This file contains data about:

*   What was retrieved from the cache.
*   How long remote execution or local execution took for different build actions.
*   Which tools (R8, D8, etc.) were executed remotely.
*   Which tools failed remotely and fell back to local execution.
