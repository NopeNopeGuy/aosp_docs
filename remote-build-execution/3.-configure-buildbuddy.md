# Building Android with Remote Build Execution (RBE)

## Configuration for BuildBuddy

### 1. Obtain Your BuildBuddy API Key

1.  **Sign In:** Go to [buildbuddy.io](https://buildbuddy.io/) and sign in with your Google or GitHub account.
2.  **Quickstart:** Navigate to the "Quickstart" section in your BuildBuddy dashboard.
3.  **Copy API Key:** You'll see a command similar to this:

    ```bash
    build --bes_backend=grpcs://your-instance.buildbuddy.io
    build --remote_header=x-buildbuddy-api-key=xxx ...
    ```

    *   Copy the entire string *after* `--remote_header=`. This is your API key. It will look like `x-buildbuddy-api-key=xxx`.
    *   Note the address after `--bes_backend=`. You only need the part *after* `grpcs://`, e.g., `your-instance.buildbuddy.io`.


### 2. Setup Environment variables for BuildBuddy

1. **Setup the Variables** Add this to your build/envsetup.sh or export them manually:
  ```bash # --- BuildBuddy Connection Settings ---
    export RBE_service="your-instance.buildbuddy.io:443"        # BuildBuddy instance address (without grpcs://, add the port 443)
    export RBE_remote_headers="x-buildbuddy-api-key=xxx"    # Your BuildBuddy API key
    export RBE_use_rpc_credentials=false
    export RBE_service_no_auth=true
   ```

### 3. **Important Notes**
   * To get access to a shared cache, please contact @NopeNopeGuy, you'll get much faster first builds and it will reduce the load on BuildBuddy's server.
